 * inputs A, B, and any two distinct outputs X, Y, the probability that
 * X=PWIP(A) and Y=PWIP(B) is uniform, that is, is 1/(2**n * (2**n-1))
 * independent of A, B, X, Y

 * outputs X, Y, Z, the probability that X=PWIP(A), Y=PWIP(B), Z=PWIP(C) is
 * independent of A, B, C, X, Y, Z
 *
 * This works by using binary matrix multiplication, the input vector is
 * treated as a vector in GF(2); it is multiplied by a randomly (uniformly
 * distributed) nxn matrix of GF(2) elements, and then added with a random
 * vector in GF(2), resulting in a random (uniformly distributed) affine
 * function
